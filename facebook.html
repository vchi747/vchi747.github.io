                <h1 style ="font-size:30px;color:#6697C3;margin:10px;"> Background </h1>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;">The design prompt that we decided to pursue is prompt three-- maintaining
                    personal connections. We specifically want to focus on reducing online clutter
                    and noise to improve one’s mental health. The personal connection app that
                    we wanted to tackle was Facebook. Facebook has a large user base that targets
                    a very extensive market. We want to add more features to the app that will
                    allow for a better experience in the app. Through crowd sourcing and internal
                    NLP algorithms, we aim to label content into categories. Sorting and labelling
                    content allows users to control the volume of information displayed and
                    creates a more controlled environment for what ultimately reaches them.
                    Our improved design solution is motivated by a trend of declining mental
                    health as users of social media applications are spending increasing amounts
                    of time aimlessly scrolling through content that is generated on their feeds.
                    Thus, in an effort to provide the option of feed management, we wanted to
                    tackle this problem area for the benefit of users who need a boost in their
                    productivity or a means to control their information input. A byproduct benefit
                    for our secondary user, Facebook, is an improvement in the existing manual
                    filtering option for individual posts so that Facebook can generate more
                    relevant content and ad recommendations for their users.</p>

                                <p style = "font-size:20px;"><b> Social media enthusiasts who are averaging 3-4 hours on Facebook daily
                                    need an improved design of the current content filtering feature on the application to better
                                    personalize their feeds with content they want to see and to reduce irrelevant information overload.</b>

                <h1 style ="font-size:30px;color:#6697C3;margin:10px;"> Research Methods </h1>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;">Our goal is to discover a specific need for users to filter content on
                    their social media feeds to give them the opportunity to receive personalized content
                    recommendations. We hope to gain varying personal experiences and perspectives on how our topic
                    can improve the daily lives of Facebook users, specifically in the midst of this global pandemic.</p>

                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> In order to answer our problem statement, we have decided to use surveys and interviews to
                    grasp a better understanding of our target population. Surveys provide us with a more standardized
                    way to compare statistical data from individual responses. It also allows the participants to give
                    their own personal feedback on the shortcomings of the social media website. That would allow us,
                    the designers, to better understand the exact problems and shortcomings of the current filters
                    implemented by Facebook. The second research method that we are implementing is interviews.
                    Interviews give us accurate accounts of personal use and help either support or reject the
                    statistical data that we have gathered from our surveys. This provides a means to double check if
                        the data we gathered from our surveys accurately reflects our target population.</p>

                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> From our initial surveys, we gathered 37 responses from members of our immediate community
                    composed of our friends, coworkers, and mutual friends. We opted for safely contacting and
                    surveying our immediate networks during these unprecedented social distancing circumstances, which
                    explains the limited reach of our survey. Moreover, we aim to conduct one-on-one interviews with
                    3 to 5 individuals from our target audience of social media enthusiasts. The Facebook users that
                    we have surveyed thus far are relevant to our design prompt since they come from varying demographic
                    backgrounds, interests, and reasons for Facebook use, but there is a relation in the amount of time
                    they spend on the application. We aim to draw connections from similarities among the problems that
                    these daily Facebook users and social media enthusiasts experience.

                <h1 style ="font-size:30px;color:#6697C3;margin:10px;"> Research Findings </h1>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> In order to get an assessment of public attitudes towards the current
                    state of Facebook, we used surveys to gather information.  We will be breaking down the information
                    gathered from our surveys.
                </p>

                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> In our surveys, we primarily utilized two methods to gauge user sentiment
                    towards Facebook. We used the Likert scale and the nominal scale.  The Likert scale was used in our
                    survey to give more freedom to the participants in conveying their feelings, choosing from a range
                    of values. It informed us about the kind of people who are using Facebook. With our Likert scale
                    question, we noticed that our data was heavily left-skewed. The “previous question” mentioned in
                    the bar graph below refers to our question asking, “How much time on average do you spend on
                    Facebook everyday?”. From the left to right, it reads “I spend too much time on Facebook” to
                    “ I am satisfied with the time I spend on Facebook”.  This was used to gauge whether users even
                    have a desire to use Facebook more or less, and from our findings we see that the majority feel
                    like they use the application just the right amount.

            <div class="col-lg-14 mx-auto">
                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> In order to dive deeper into our problem scope we decided to observe
                    users’ reactions and feelings towards the content popping up in their news feeds. To our surprise,
                    a substantial number of people were not completely dissatisfied with what they currently see on Facebook.
                </p>

                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> This brings up one of the strongest findings in our survey: Around 20
                    percent of our participants are not happy with what they see on Facebook, responding with
                    “Not completely” and “No”. This percentage was shocking to us because we constantly hear how
                    people dislike Facebook’s recommendations and posts in passing conversations. Combining this
                    statistic with our follow-up question, we get a better understanding of our participants. It leads
                    into another interesting finding to be deduced.

                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> In our follow-up question we asked if users know about Facebook’s
                    built in filter to remove content. Around 75% of our respondents knew of or used this filter
                    while using the app.

            <div class="col-lg-14 mx-auto">
                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> Combining the data from this and the previous question’s data, we can
                    draw a notable connection. Since users mostly like the content they see and are using the built in
                    filter on Facebook, it proves that filters do improve user experience, but it can be improved to
                    encompass more individuals that do not yet know of its existence.
                </p>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> Personal feedback from participants provided significant information to us
                    about specific wishes and desires because it allowed them to give personal accounts of their
                    experiences and preferences. We found some common feedback amongst all answers we received:
                </p>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;"><b> 1. The first one that we found to be very prevalent were responses that
                    mentioned political posts. We see that political views either drive people or deter people from
                    using Facebook more.</b>
                </p>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;"><b> 2. The next frequent responses were ones related to ads. Ads are one of
                    Facebook’s main sources of revenue. Removing them would destroy the company, so we took this input
                    to consider making an improved filter that aligns with personal interests more accurately, promoting
                    positive feedback to ads without removing them altogether.
                </b>
                </p>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> From these personal responses from our recipients, we noticed a unifying
                    theme, a desire to have greater control of content that they see. Facebook already has filters
                    in-place but they are preset by the internal algorithms, leaving the user with minimal control in
                    determining and managing the content they want to see.
                </p>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> To summarize our findings, around 20 percent of our participants do not
                    like the current state of their news feed. Moreover, many of our participants currently use
                    Facebook’s filters to improve their content, but they still are dissatisfied with the current state
                    of Facebook’s filters.

                    competitive analysis
                    helped form a better understanding of existing filtering and content-recommending solutions.
                    We observed that while most of the popular  social media applications tackle the problem of hiding
                    individual irrelevant user profiles or posts, they do not allow users to filter their feeds based
                    on the specific categories that we want to tackle-- e.g., mood, recent, content.

                    screen to be the entry point because that is what the user first sees when they log into the website/app.
                    The flow is split into three different options the user can choose in order to improve their experience.
                    The main three things that they can manipulate are the posts, advertisements, and user settings.
                    Each of the listed things access different screens that allow the user to customize their account.
                    For the Post and Advertisements, each have their ability to completely remove what they see but then
                    we added our classification feature as a new screen that users can go into. The Classify Post screen
                    would allow users to classify the post based on the Genre, Mood, and if it's popular or not. The third
                    option from the Home screen would be the user settings. The user can enter and change options about
                    their Timeline and Ads. This goes to the heart of trying to fix our problem, which is to filter out
                    unnecessary noise from posts.

            From iterating on a multitude of hand-drawn sketches, we learned that there can be multiple variations of a
            screen that can impact the way a user interacts with a feature. The interaction with an interface can affect
            the complexity of performing the function itself. Thus, we strived to make it as intuitive as possible.

                    option for our design extension of Facebook’s content filtering feature.The Wireframe is an iteration
                    of our UX Flow, which focuses on using the existing means of directly managing individual posts to
                    access the content filtering feature while also adding it as an option within the user’s settings.
                    This wireframe adds nested pages and drop-down menus for Facebook’s current icons for accessing
                    settings. This option allows the users to easily access the filter settings from the user’s profile
                    settings as well as individual posts and advertisements.

                    This wireframe allows users to manually categorize posts in real-time as
                    they appear on their news feed. It offers multiple entry points from the home page that are
                    seamlessly integrated into existing menu buttons and settings.It offers a
                    solution for our problem statement by providing users with methods to reduce
                    information overload and personalize their news feeds.

                    remote interviews due to the social-distanced circumstances for COVID.

                    low-fidelity prototypes. One of the users we interviewed shared this about the
                    filter icon to create new filters for the news feed, “The top buttons are very intuitive. I know
                    I either click on the funnel cone for filter, search button, and messenger. Those are nice to have
                    at the top since I probably [would] use those most”. They went on to describe the structure of the
                    content filtering page from our low-fidelity prototype saying, “I like how the recent filters are
                    at the top. It’s helpful given that people typically search the same things and if they want to
                    they can access new filters but the recent ones are at your disposal”. We used these insights to
                    model our high-fidelity prototype from this element of our low-fidelity one.
                </p>

                <p style = "font-size:20px;"> Users who frequent social media applications want to feel connected with others and this is something our
                    design extension hopes to achieve by considering feedback from our low-fidelity
                    prototype and implementing them into our 2 entry points shown in our high-fidelity prototype above.
